    # This CI would normally use silverstripe/gha-ci/.github/workflows/ci.yml@v1 however it does not
    # reason being the only job generated is the 'JS' job which includes rebuilding the css
    # This cannot pass because of statements such as editor.scss
    # @import "../../../starter/node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";
    # which isn't possible to resolve in the current shared CI because it assumes that cwp/cwp-starter-theme
    # is installed in a sibling theme dirrectly AND that npm install was run on it
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
